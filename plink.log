Reading map (extended format) from [ /data/jaga/stophcv/steven/August2016/step2/August2016.bim ] 
830114 markers to be included from [ /data/jaga/stophcv/steven/August2016/step2/August2016.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ /data/jaga/stophcv/steven/August2016/step2/August2016.fam ] 
3814 individuals read from [ /data/jaga/stophcv/steven/August2016/step2/August2016.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 3814 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 3814 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 3814 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
These individuals will be set to missing ( or use --allow-no-sex )
Writing list of these individuals to [ plink.nosex ]
Reading genotype bitfile from [ /data/jaga/stophcv/steven/August2016/step2/August2016.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 830114 SNPs
3814 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is nan
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 830114 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 3814 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 3814 of unspecified sex
